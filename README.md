# My-Code-Quiz

# Description

This code quiz was created for a quick snapshot of how much coding terms you can retain from the first few weeks of being in a Full Stack coding bootcamp.  The quiz is on a timer so you may or may not have enough time to look the answers up.  Please enjoy as this coding quiz was made with tlc, as well as, frustration and total stubborness.
